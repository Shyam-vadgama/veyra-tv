        <span class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 26, 2025</span>

        <p>Veyra TV ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Android application.</p>

        <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data, usage statistics, or user identifiers. Veyra TV operates entirely locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
        <p>Any data you input into the app, such as M3U playlist URLs or channel favorites, is stored locally on your device's internal storage using secure Android APIs (Room Database). We do not have access to this data, and it is never transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app may use third-party libraries for core functionality (e.g., ExoPlayer for media playback). These libraries function locally. We do not use third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics or Firebase) to track user behavior.</p>

        <h2>4. Media Content</h2>
        <p>Veyra TV does not provide any content. You are responsible for the playlists you load. The app acts solely as a player to render the streams you provide. We do not monitor or log the content you stream.</p>

        <h2>5. Crash Reporting</h2>
        <p>Currently, we do not use automatic crash reporting tools. If the app crashes, no logs are sent to us automatically. You may voluntarily choose to share logs via GitHub Issues when reporting a bug.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date on this page.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
